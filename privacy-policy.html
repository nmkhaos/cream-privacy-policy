        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 15, 2025<br>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 15, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cream ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Cream mobile application (the "App"), a Flutter-based finance tracking application available on iOS and Android platforms. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <p><strong>App Information:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Built with Flutter framework (Dart programming language)</li>
            <li><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> iOS and Android</li>
            <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Local-first, offline-capable application</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> All data stored locally on your device</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our App.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not collect personally identifiable information from users.</strong> The Cream app is designed to work completely offline, and we do not require user registration, email addresses, names, phone numbers, or any other personal information to use the app.</p>

        <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>The App may collect certain information automatically for app functionality and support purposes. All information is collected locally and is not transmitted to external servers unless explicitly stated below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Basic device information such as device model, operating system version (iOS/Android), and app version. This information is collected using Flutter's <code>device_info_plus</code> package and <code>package_info_plus</code> package for debugging and support purposes only. This information is stored locally and is not transmitted to external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>App Version Information</strong>: App version number and build number are collected locally for support and debugging purposes. This information is included in support requests if you choose to contact us through the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform-Specific Information</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>iOS</strong>: Device model, iOS version, system version</li>
                    <li><strong>Android</strong>: Device model, Android version, SDK version</li>
                </ul>
                This information is collected locally only and used for technical support.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Usage patterns and interaction data may be collected locally within the app for debugging purposes in development mode only. This data is not shared with third parties and is only used for app improvement and bug fixing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> All automatically collected information remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties, except as explicitly disclosed in the Third-Party Services section below.</p>

        <h3>Financial Data</h3>
        <p>All financial data you enter into the App is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transactions</strong>: Manual income and expense entries</li>
            <li><strong>Budget Items</strong>: Recurring monthly income and expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Recurring subscription services and costs</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Goals</strong>: Savings goals, target amounts, and progress tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Summaries</strong>: Automated financial summaries and analytics</li>
            <li><strong>User Profile</strong> (Optional): Optional demographic information (life stage, age range, household type) used only for personalized financial guidance within the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All financial data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is never transmitted to our servers</li>
            <li>Is never shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Remains under your complete control</li>
            <li>Can be exported by you at any time in CSV or JSON format</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services and SDKs</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services and SDKs. We have carefully selected these services to minimize data collection while maintaining app functionality.</p>
        
        <h3>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</h3>
        <p>The App includes Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) SDK via the <code>google_mobile_ads</code> Flutter package. This SDK is only active when ad features are enabled by the user in app settings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Information that may be collected by AdMob when ads are enabled:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers (such as advertising IDs)</li>
            <li>IP addresses</li>
            <li>Location information (if enabled on your device)</li>
            <li>App interaction data related to ads</li>
            <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>AdMob Privacy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>AdMob's use of information is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li>You can manage your advertising preferences through your device settings or <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Ad Settings</a></li>
            <li>You can reset your advertising ID at any time through your device settings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Ad features are <strong>opt-in only</strong> and can be disabled at any time in the app settings. When ad features are disabled, the AdMob SDK is not initialized and no ad-related data collection occurs.</p>
        
        <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
        <p>The App uses Google Fonts via the <code>google_fonts</code> Flutter package to provide consistent typography. When fonts are loaded, Google may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address (for font delivery)</li>
            <li>User agent information</li>
            <li>Referrer information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data collection is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. Fonts are typically cached locally after first load to minimize subsequent requests.</p>
        
        <h3>Other Third-Party Packages</h3>
        <p>The App uses the following Flutter packages that operate entirely locally and do not transmit data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>sqflite</strong>: Local SQLite database (no data transmission)</li>
            <li><strong>shared_preferences</strong>: Local key-value storage (no data transmission)</li>
            <li><strong>flutter_secure_storage</strong>: Local secure storage for sensitive data (no data transmission)</li>
            <li><strong>local_auth</strong>: Biometric authentication (processed locally, no data transmission)</li>
            <li><strong>path_provider</strong>: Local file system access (no data transmission)</li>
            <li><strong>device_info_plus</strong>: Device information (collected locally only, as described above)</li>
            <li><strong>package_info_plus</strong>: App version information (collected locally only, as described above)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these packages operate entirely on your device and do not transmit any data to external servers.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the limited information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>App Functionality</strong>: To provide, maintain, and improve the App's features and performance</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging and Support</strong>: To diagnose technical issues and provide user support</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>: To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All financial data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted to external servers</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted at rest on your device using standard platform encryption</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Security Measures</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, following Flutter and mobile app security best practices:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Storage Security:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local-only data storage using SQLite database (via <code>sqflite</code> package)</li>
            <li>Device-level encryption at rest (provided by iOS/Android platform)</li>
            <li>Secure storage for sensitive data using <code>flutter_secure_storage</code> package</li>
            <li>Platform-specific secure storage:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>iOS</strong>: Keychain Services for secure credential storage</li>
                    <li><strong>Android</strong>: EncryptedSharedPreferences using Android Keystore</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Authentication Security:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optional PIN lock with configurable length</li>
            <li>Optional biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint) via <code>local_auth</code> package</li>
            <li>Biometric data is processed locally and never stored or transmitted</li>
            <li>PIN storage uses platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore)</li>
            <li>Failed authentication attempts are logged locally only</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Network Security:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No external data transmission for financial data</li>
            <li>No cloud synchronization or backup services</li>
            <li>HTTPS used for any external requests (fonts, ads when enabled)</li>
            <li>Certificate pinning not implemented (not required for local-only app)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Code Security:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built with Flutter framework following security best practices</li>
            <li>No obfuscation of financial data (data remains readable for export)</li>
            <li>Secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Platform-Specific Security:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS</strong>: App Sandbox restrictions, Keychain Services, App Transport Security</li>
            <li><strong>Android</strong>: Android Keystore, App Sandbox, Secure Random number generation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We recommend that you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Use a strong PIN or biometric authentication</li>
            <li>Keep your device physically secure</li>
            <li>Regularly export and backup your data</li>
        </ul>
